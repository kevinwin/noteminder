## Noteminder
## Created by Kevin Nguyen & Michael Le
#### July 1, 2014


#### Overview
Noteminder is a Ruby on Rails app that allows people to create notes and 
have them sent back via email/text right when they need to review them.
The app uses a Spaced Repetition gem, background process, chron jobs, and sms messaging through (twilio and rr)
Noteminder lets people focus on what they want to study. Not planning study sessions.


#### Motivation
Michael and I created this app because we both wanted something that would help us learn more effectively
without having users enter a dedicated program to access our notes. We wanted to fill the gap between
spaced repetition and email/text integration because email/phones are natural extensions of our workflow.


#### Content
-Email/SMS integration
-Spaced repetition algorithm (Supermemo 2)
-Dashboard for note organization (compile, delete, create, archive, and share decks)

#### Future features
Note synchronization
Contextual tracking


#### Design
A minimalist design with strong contrasting elements.
