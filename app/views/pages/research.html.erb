												<p>Yes, you can. Once you received your first notification from an app you would like to mute, you can disable it in Notifyr's preference panel. This might be useful when you already receive notifications from certain services on both your iOS device and your Mac, such as Twitter or your mail. Disabling the application in Notifyr will make sure you won't receive any double notifications.</p>

							<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">The Testing Effect</h1>
							<p>The Testing Effect is all about the idea that testing memory inherently strengthens memory of the tested subject. Here are a few articles on the topic. </p>
							<ul style="list-style: circle;">
								<li><p>Allen, G.A., Mahler, W.A., &amp; Estes, W.K. (1969). <a href="./docs/spacedrepetition/1969-allen.pdf">“Effects of recall tests on long-term retention of paired associates”</a>. <em>Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior</em>, 8, 463-470</p>
							<p>1 test results in memories as strong a day later as studying 5 times; intervals improve retention compared to massed presentation.</p></li>
							<li><p>Karpicke &amp; Roediger (2003). <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Karpicke-The-critical-importance-of-retrieval-for-learning.pdf">“The Critical Importance of Retrieval for Learning”</a></p>
							<p>In learning Swahili vocabulary, students were given varying routines of testing or studying or testing and studying; this resulted in similar scores during the learning phase. Students were asked to predict what percentage they’d remember (average: 50% over all groups). One week later, the students who tested remembered ~80% of the vocabulary versus ~35% for non-testing students. Some students were tested or studied more than others; diminishing returns set in very quickly once the memory had formed the first day. Students reported rarely testing themselves and not testing already learned items.</p>
						<p>Lesson: again, testing improves memory compared to studying. Also, no student knows this.</p></li>
						<li><p>Roediger &amp; Karpicke (2006a). <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Roediger-Test-Enhanced-Learning.pdf">“Test-Enhanced Learning: Taking Memory Tests Improves Long-Term Retention”</a></p>
						<p>Students were tested (with no feedback) on reading comprehension of a passage over 5 minutes, 2 days, and 1 week. Studying beat testing over 5 minutes, but nowhere else; students believed studying superior to testing over all intervals. At 1 week, testing scores were ~60% versus ~40%.</p>
					Lesson: testing improves memory compared to studying. Everyone (teachers &amp; students) ‘knows’ the opposite.</li>
					<li><p>Karpicke &amp; Roediger (2006a). <a href="http://learninglab.psych.purdue.edu/downloads/2007_Karpicke_Roediger_JEPLMC.pdf">“Expanding retrieval promotes short-term retention, but equal interval retrieval enhances long-term retention”</a></p>
				General scientific prose comprehension; from Roediger &amp; Karpicke 2006b: “After 2 days, initial testing produced better retention than restudying (68% vs. 54%), and an advantage of testing over restudying was also observed after 1 week (56% vs. 42%).”</li>
				<li><p>Roediger &amp; Karpicke (2006b). <a href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Roediger-The-power-of-testing-memory.pdf">“The Power of Testing Memory: Basic Research and Implications for Educational Practice”</a></p>
				Literature review; 7 studies before 1941 demonstrating testing improves retention, and 6 afterwards.

			As with #2, the purer forms of testing (in this case, open-book versus closed-book testing) did better over the long run, and students were deluded about what worked best.</li>
