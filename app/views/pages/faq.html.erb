				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7;">How do I use NoteMinders?</h1>
				<p>Start by creating an account. Once signed up, you'll be redirected to a create notes page. Create a note. You should receive an email confirmation with your note. Just glance at the note and give it some feedback by submitting the form at the bottom of the email/text. From then on the algorithm will send you the note via text/email right at the point at which you're most likely to forget it. Over time, (if you're honest about how much you recall) the algorithm gets smarter and will send you the note less frequently. It's completely personalized.</p>

				<a name="cantfind"><h1>It seems like Notifyr on my Mac can't find my iPhone</h1>
				<p>Please make sure you downloaded the Notifyr iOS client, read the instructions and keep it open while selecting a device from the Notifyr prefspanel on your Mac.</p>
			</div>

			<!-- <div class="question">
				<a name="mute"><h1>Can I mute notifications?</h1>
				<p>Yes, you can. Once you received your first notification from an app you would like to mute, you can disable it in Notifyr's preference panel. This might be useful when you already receive notifications from certain services on both your iOS device and your Mac, such as Twitter or your mail. Disabling the application in Notifyr will make sure you won't receive any double notifications.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Help! I don't have any notes.</h1>
				<p>Don't worry. Creating notes is easy. Just sign in if you haven't done so already. Select a deck, enter a question field and an appropriate answer field. Click submit.</p>
				<p>Congratulations! You've just created your first note. A success message should pop up at the top of the screen confirming this. </p>

			<!-- <div class="question">
				<a name="calls"><h1>Do I also receive updates on incoming calls?</h1>
				<p>Yes, Notifyr will let you know about any incoming calls, missed calls and new voicemails.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Why does NoteMinders ask for my email/phone number?</h1>

				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Who's behind NoteMinders?</h1>
				<p><strong>Kevin:</strong> I'm a 21-year-old developer from the United States studying neuroscience at Dartmouth College and I like gorging on sushi, meditating, and hiking freakishly tall mountains. I'm what many people consider a late bloomer and built my first program in CS1 during my freshman year. The process was so fun but I was intimidated by what I didn't know; as a result, I never got around to doing a personal project until now. 
				Of course, this project is still a work in progress so let us know if there are any bugs or must-have features that are missing. We'd love to hear from you.</p>
