# Spaced Repetition learning app
#### By Kevin Nguyen, June 26, 2014

## Description

I want to build an application that makes learning more effective, easy, and fun.
I want to have notes that come back to me when I need to review them the most before that information disappears from my short-term memory.
I want these notes to be easily accessible
& I want to be able to see these notes wherever I am.
I don't want to have to think about when I need to study. I just want to focus on studying what I want to learn when I need to learn it.	


## Features

1. Note creation (Flashcard style, plain text, test mode for the testing effect)
2. Account signup process only needed for extra features.  Email and phone numbers act as iDs
3. Text messages/emails w/ your note (note reminder) are sent automatically based on a Spaced repetition algorithm
4. supports font styles for code (monospace) & special characters (chinese, vietnamese tone symbols)
5. Open source and free.
6. Possible addition for future iteration: context-sensitive learning algorithm (detects location and balances learning load) could also generate a visual/audio cue that acts as a signal to learn.
7. (could support visual memes ---not sure if I should keep it simpler and more basic)
8. (Supports short testing sessions)
9 (Could support calendar synchronisation and Do Not Disturb windows where no emails or texts are esent)
10. Does not support shared decks...at least in the first few reps (learning should be personalized and active)


Useful for learning just about anything
computer language syntax
natural languages --- Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Afrikaans, Russian
other school stuff


Personal context

At school, I tend to study harder and longer than I need to even when I've done enough work. Especially right before exams. I'll generally review my notes again and again when I could be spending time with friends or doing something else that's fun. It's like reviewing things you'd actually remember without actually needing to review it. I guess It's the workaholic in me. 

It's also about not forgetting material. On average, 70% of students forget what was taught in a 1 hour class within 24 hours.

I think technology could definitely help. The app I have in mind would allow you to create a note, something you want to learn and it would send you a text/email when you need to review the material only when you need to review it --- which is right before you forget it based on a spaced repetition algorithm. Effectively serves as a tag for your brain that this is something important to remember. The goal is to focus on what you want to learn/retain, not on when you should study.

==================================================================

# Create a note
1. User visits the site.
2. They input their email/phone unless it's already been saved as an account and they have auto sign-in
3. User clicks on a simple flashcard and types whatever they want to remember/learn. Users with official accounts can organize their notes into decks by clicking a dropdown.
4. User clicks 'Create' button

Official accounts have access to a dashboard with more advanced functions (context, visual memes, both phone and text reminders, analytics, opens new tab); Basic accounts have the ability to see all their notes and organize them into decks and can set no-interrupt times.

# reviewing a recalled note
1. User receives an email/text notifying them that their note is ready for review. After a note is created, it's sent to the user immediately
2. User can see the full text of their note in their email.
3. User marks their recall ability on a scale of 1-5 (5 being super easy to recall, 1 being no recall)
4. Algorithm records their rating and sends them the information at an appropriate time.

# Basic account creation
1. User creates note with new phone/email
2. If the phone / email is not in the database, it's added temporarily.
3. User confirmation link is set via text / Email
