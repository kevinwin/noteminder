				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7;">How do I use NoteMinders?</h1>
				<p>First, you'll need to download the iOS application from the . Then you need to download and install the <a href="http://getnotifyr.com/mac/">Notifyr prefspanel</a> for Mac.</p><p> Make sure bluetooth is enabled on both devices and open the iOS app. You'll be asked permission to your bluetooth settings and follow the instructions in the iOS app. As soon as you'll see an iPhone and animating circle 'beams' you need to go open the Notifyr prefspanel on the Mac. You'll find the prefspanel under the general settings panel from you Mac. Open the Notifyr panel and press the 'select device' button on the right bottom. While you Mac is searching for your iPhone make sure the iOS app is open to the foreground and you iPhone isn't locked.</p> <p>Now you just need to select your iPhone on your Mac and enter the code to pair the devices.</p><p>Do not 'kill' (remove from multitasking) Notifyr. If you do, you'll need to reopen the iOS app to reconnect.</p>

				<a name="cantfind"><h1>It seems like Notifyr on my Mac can't find my iPhone</h1>
				<p>Please make sure you downloaded the Notifyr iOS client, read the instructions and keep it open while selecting a device from the Notifyr prefspanel on your Mac.</p>

			<!-- <div class="question">
				<a name="mute"><h1>Can I mute notifications?</h1>
				<p>Yes, you can. Once you received your first notification from an app you would like to mute, you can disable it in Notifyr's preference panel. This might be useful when you already receive notifications from certain services on both your iOS device and your Mac, such as Twitter or your mail. Disabling the application in Notifyr will make sure you won't receive any double notifications.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Help! I don't have any notes.</h1>
				<p>Don't worry. An app will be added to the list as soon as it gets its first notification.</p>
			</div>
			
			<hr>
			
			<!-- <div class="question">
				<a name="calls"><h1>Do I also receive updates on incoming calls?</h1>
				<p>Yes, Notifyr will let you know about any incoming calls, missed calls and new voicemails.</p>
			</div>
			
			<hr> -->
			
			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Why does NoteMinders ask for my email/phone number?</h1>
				<p>Due to Apple's aggressive caching in OS X, Notifyr has trouble reconnecting to your iOS device once it loses power or restarts its Bluetooth radio. In order to fix this problem and ensure a smooth reconnection in every possible scenario, we need to clear the Bluetooth cache on your Mac. To do this, we need your password.</p>
				<p>Don't worry though, Notifyr will only clear the bit of Bluetooth cache that's related to your iOS device and will only do this when it's absolutely necessary. The process in charge of clearing the cache is completely separated from the rest of the app, so there's no security risk.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">How do I uninstall Noteminders?</h1>
				<p>On your Mac, simply disable Notifyr and remove the preference panel by right clicking on its icon. On your iOS device, hold the app's icon and press the X-button.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">How do I manage my notes?</h1>
				<p> worked with Notifyr. If you succeeded using Notifyr with a Bluetooth dongle, please let me know if it works so I can make a list with supported dongles.</p>

			<div class="question">
				<h1 style="color:#4D8DC7">Who's behind NoteMinders?</h1>
				<p>My name's Kevin and I'm a 21-year-old developer from the United States. I got my first iPhone when I was 12 years old, and started making apps for it as soon as the SDK was released by Apple. Since I was mainly working as a freelancer, I never got around to doing a personal project until now. I've been working on Notifyr for over half a year, mainly studying the Bluetooth technologies in iOS and OS X to create the perfect user experience.</p>
